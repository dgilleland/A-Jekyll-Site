# A Jekyll Site

Basically, this is a "sandbox" website where I can get a better grip on Jekyll websites on GitHub.

I have specifically started *without* a theme, because I want to make my own theme(s). (I also just want to see what GitHub will generate without a theme chosen at the start....).

Here's a link to my [About](About.md) page. Notice a couple of things: 1) The link uses a `.md` extension (making it work when navigating on the gitHub repository), and 2) the link works correctly in the generated browser page, because the (default) Jekyll template used by GitHub replaces the `.md` extension with `.html` to match the generated html page. Sweet! :+1:
