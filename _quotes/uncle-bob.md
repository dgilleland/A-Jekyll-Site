> Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write. <cite>― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</cite>

> So if you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read. <cite>― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</cite>

> Clean code is not written by following a set of rules. You don’t become a software craftsman by learning a list of heuristics. Professionalism and craftsmanship come from values that drive disciplines. <cite>― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</cite>
